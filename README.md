Nerdy and traped behind a counter trying to make ends meet doing a job he hates while he is clearly feeling sick, all pale looking and shit. 

Good for him man! No matter how bad life treated him he pulled through! 
And the most important thing of all? He is the inspiration behind the creation of this repository! 

## How to grab the ball

We have never stopped talking about Pokeballs! Get your stuff together! 

Ok so here is how my awesome output looks like!

That's what i am talking about! 

## Step | One 

Create a div that you want to place the ball in and paste the following HTML structure: 

```html
<div class="poke_box">
    <div class="pokeball">
        <div class="pokeball__button"></div>
    </div>   
</div>
```


## Step | Two

Have the same CSS as i do and it should work! Take a look

I even made the Pokeball move and Blink when hovered by a mouse cursor!
